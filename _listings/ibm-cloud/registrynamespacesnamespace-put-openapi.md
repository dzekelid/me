  title: IBM Containers Set a namespace for your private Bluemix registry.
  description: "Set up your own Docker images registry in Bluemix by defining a namespace
    for your organization (corresponding IBM Containers command: `cf ic namespace
    set <namespace>`). The namespace is used to generate a unique URL to your private
    Bluemix registry. In your private registry you store all Docker images that you
    want to share across your organization. To create a container from an image, you
    must first push the image to your registry. \n\n The namespace cannot be changed
    after is has been set. Consider the following rules to choose a namespace for
    your organization: \n\n- Every organization can have one namespace at a time only
    \n- The namespace must be unique in Bluemix. \n- The namespace can be 4-30 characters
    long. \n- The namespace must start with at least one letter or number. \n- The
    namespace can only contain lowercase letters, numbers or underscores (_)."
