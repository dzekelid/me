  title: Google Proximity Beacon API Add Attachment
  description: |-
    Associates the given data with the specified beacon. Attachment data must
    contain two parts:
    <ul>
    <li>A namespaced type.</li>
    <li>The actual attachment data itself.</li>
    </ul>
    The namespaced type consists of two parts, the namespace and the type.
    The namespace must be one of the values returned by the `namespaces`
    endpoint, while the type can be a string of any characters except for the
    forward slash (`/`) up to 100 characters in length.

    Attachment data can be up to 1024 bytes long.

      description: |-
        Deletes the specified attachment for the given beacon. Each attachment has
        a unique attachment name (`attachmentName`) which is returned when you
        fetch the attachment data via this API. You specify this with the delete
        request to control which attachment is removed. This operation cannot be
        undone.

      description: |-
        Returns the attachments for the specified beacon that match the specified
        namespaced-type pattern.

        To control which namespaced types are returned, you add the
        `namespacedType` query parameter to the request. You must either use
        `*/*`, to return all attachments, or the namespace must be one of
        the ones returned from the  `namespaces` endpoint.
