    **This endpoint allows you to retrive the monthly email statistics for a specific subuser.**

    While you can always view the statistics for all email activity on your account, subuser statistics enable you to view specific segments of your stats for your subusers. Emails sent, bounces, and spam reports are always tracked for subusers. Unsubscribes, clicks, and opens are tracked if you have enabled the required settings.

    When using the `sort_by_metric` to sort your stats by a specific metric, you can not sort by the following metrics:
    `bounce_drops`, `deferred`, `invalid_emails`, `processed`, `spam_report_drops`, `spam_reports`, or `unsubscribe_drops`.

    For more information, see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Statistics/subuser.html).

    **This endpoint allows you to update a specific inbound parse setting.**

    The inbound parse webhook allows you to have incoming emails parsed, extracting some or all of the contnet, and then have that content POSTed by SendGrid to a URL of your choosing. For more information, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/parse.html).
