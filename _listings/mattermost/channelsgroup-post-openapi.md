      summary: Switch login method
      description: |-
        Switch a user's login method from using email to OAuth2/SAML/LDAP or back to email. When switching to OAuth2/SAML, account switching is not complete until the user follows the returned link and completes any steps on the OAuth2/SAML service provider.

        To switch from email to OAuth2/SAML, specify `current_service`, `new_service`, `email` and `password`.

        To switch from OAuth2/SAML to email, specify `current_service`, `new_service`, `email` and `new_password`.

        To switch from email to LDAP/AD, specify `current_service`, `new_service`, `email`, `password`, `ldap_ip` and `new_password` (this is the user's LDAP password).

        To switch from LDAP/AD to email, specify `current_service`, `new_service`, `ldap_ip`, `password` (this is the user's LDAP password), `email`  and `new_password`.

        Additionally, specify `mfa_code` when trying to switch an account on LDAP/AD or email that has MFA activated.

        ##### Permissions
        No current authentication required except when switching from OAuth2/SAML to email.
