  /nodes/{node_id}/comments/:
    get:
      summary: List all comments
      description: |-
        A paginated list of comments related to a given node.

        The returned comments are sorted by their creation date, with the most recent comments appearing first.
        ####Permissions
        Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the node comment-level is `private`, only contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.
        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of comment objects. Each resource in the array is a separate comment object.

        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include comments that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ezcuj/comments/?filter[target_id]=jg7sezmdnt93

        Nodes may be filtered by their `deleted`, `target_id`, `date_created`, `date_modified`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail.

      summary: Create a comment
      description: |-

        To create a comment on the node overview page, the target `type` would be "nodes" and the target `id` would be the node `id`.

        To reply to a comment on this node, the target `type` would be "comments" and the target `id` would be the `id` of the comment to reply to.
        ####Required
        A relationship object with a `data` key, containing the target (`comments` or `nodes`) type and a target `id` is required.
        In addition, the `content` attribute describing the relationship between the node and the comment is required.
        ####Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a data key containing the representation of the new comment, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        ####Permissions
        Comments of public registrations are given read-only access to everyone.

        If the comment-level is `private`, only registration contributors have permission to comment.

        If the comment-level is `public`, any logged-in OSF user can comment.

        Comments of private registrations are only visible to contributors and administrators on the registration.
        ####Returns
